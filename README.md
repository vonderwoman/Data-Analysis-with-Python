Data analysis projects

*Data Analysis*

In a world increasingly centralized around information technology, huge amounts of data are produced and stored each day. Often these data come from automatic detection systems, sensors, and scientific instrumentation, or you produce them daily and unconsciously every time you make a withdrawal from the bank or make a purchase, when you record on various blogs, or even when you post on social networks (Nelli,2015). 

But what are the data? The data actually are not information, at least in terms of their form. In the formless stream of bytes, at first glance it is difficult to understand their essence if not strictly the number, word, or time that they report. Information is actually the result of processing, which taking into account a certain set of data, extracts some conclusions that can be used in various ways. This process of extracting information from the raw data is precisely data analysis (Nelli,2015).

# Bike sharing Project

This project is about analyzing data from bike sharing project and identify usage patterns depending on time features and weather conditions. 

**Objective** 

In this project, concepts like visual analysis and hypothesis testing  has been implemented. 

**Data Set**

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions,precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to  the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com.  

  

**Associated tasks**

  
- Regression:  

	Predication of bike rental count hourly or daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings. 

	 

- Event and Anomaly Detection:   

	Count of rented bikes are also correlated to some events in the town which easily are traceable via search engines. 

		For instance, query like "2012-10-30 washington d.c." in Google returns related results to Hurricane Sandy. Some of the important events are identified in [1]. Therefore the data can be used for validation of anomaly or event detection algorithms as well.

# Youth Global Unemployment Rate Project

**Stucture used in this project**

-Understanding the data set 

-Understanding the problem statement  

-Importing the dataset into DataFrame  

-Exploring, selecting, cleaning, and preparing the data 

 -Performing the data analysis and plotting the summary 

**Objectives** 

-Understanding how to solve real-time data analysis problems  

-Reading and analyzing the data from an external file  

-Finding answers by analyzing the data and plotting the results 



**Overview of our Dataset** 

Our dataset will be taken from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/).  

Youth Global Unemployment Rate information: unemployment is a significant indicator. This data set contains 267 countries’ youth unemployment information from 1991 to 2021. This dataset has the following columns: ‘Country Name’, ‘Country Code’, ‘1991’, ‘1992’, ‘1993’, ‘1994’, ‘1995’, ‘1996’, ‘1997’, ‘1998’, ‘1999’, ‘2000’, ‘2001’, ‘2002’, ‘2003’, ‘2004’, ‘2005’, ‘2006’, ‘2007’, ‘2008’, ‘2009’, ‘2010’, ‘2011’, ‘2012’, ‘2013’, ‘2014’, ‘2015’, ‘2016’, ‘2017’, ‘2018’, ‘2019’, ‘2020’, ‘2021 Country Name column contains the name of the country, the Country Code has the three character country code, and the rest of the columns with year (like 1991,1992….2021) contain the unemployment rate for that particular year. 

**Problem statements** 

-We need to analyze the youth global unemployment dataset for the last five years, from 2017 to 2021, to get the answers for the following points and plot the results: 

 -List all the countries where youth unemployment is greater than or equal to 25% in 2021. 

 -List all countries where youth unemployment is less than or equal to 1% in 2021.  

-Top 10 countries that have an average high rate of youth unemployment from 2017 to 2021  

-Top 10 countries that have an average low rate of youth unemployment from 2017 to 2021  

-Top 10 countries that have a high COVID impact (for years 2019 and 2020)  

-Top 10 countries that have a less COVID impact (for years 2019 and 2020)
