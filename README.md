*Data Analysis*

In a world increasingly centralized around information technology, huge amounts of data are produced and stored each day. Often these data come from automatic detection systems, sensors, and scientific instrumentation, or you produce them daily and unconsciously every time you make a withdrawal from the bank or make a purchase, when you record on various blogs, or even when you post on social networks (Nelli,2015). 

But what are the data? The data actually are not information, at least in terms of their form. In the formless stream of bytes, at first glance it is difficult to understand their essence if not strictly the number, word, or time that they report. Information is actually the result of processing, which taking into account a certain set of data, extracts some conclusions that can be used in various ways. This process of extracting information from the raw data is precisely data analysis (Nelli,2015).

# Bike sharing Project

This project is about analyzing data from bike sharing project and identify usage patterns depending on time features and weather conditions. 

**Objective** 

In this project, concepts like visual analysis,hypothesis testing and time series analysis will be done to the data. 

**Associated Tasks** 

***Data processing 

    -preprocessing temporal and weather features 

   -Registered versus casual use analysis 

***Hypothesis testing

  -Estimating average registered rides 

 -Hypothesis testing on registered rides 


***Analysis of weather-related features(pearson and spearman correlations used) 


***Time Series Analysis 

  -Time series decomposition in trends,seasonality and residual components 

***Arima Models 

  -ACF and PACF plots for Registered rides 

-Investigating  the impact of weather conditions on rides 

 

 

# Youth Global Unemployment Rate Project

Stucture used in this project 

Understanding the data set 

Understanding the problem statement  

Importing the dataset into DataFrame  

Exploring, selecting, cleaning, and preparing the data 

 Performing the data analysis and plotting the summary 

Objectives 

Understanding how to solve real-time data analysis problems  

Reading and analyzing the data from an external file  

Finding answers by analyzing the data and plotting the results 



Understanding the Dataset 

Our dataset will be taken from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/).  

Youth Global Unemployment Rate information: unemployment is a significant indicator. This data set contains 267 countries’ youth unemployment information from 1991 to 2021. This dataset has the following columns: ‘Country Name’, ‘Country Code’, ‘1991’, ‘1992’, ‘1993’, ‘1994’, ‘1995’, ‘1996’, ‘1997’, ‘1998’, ‘1999’, ‘2000’, ‘2001’, ‘2002’, ‘2003’, ‘2004’, ‘2005’, ‘2006’, ‘2007’, ‘2008’, ‘2009’, ‘2010’, ‘2011’, ‘2012’, ‘2013’, ‘2014’, ‘2015’, ‘2016’, ‘2017’, ‘2018’, ‘2019’, ‘2020’, ‘2021 Country Name column contains the name of the country, the Country Code has the three character country code, and the rest of the columns with year (like 1991,1992….2021) contain the unemployment rate for that particular year. 

Problem statements 

We need to analyze the youth global unemployment dataset for the last five years, from 2017 to 2021, to get the answers for the following points and plot the results: 

 List all the countries where youth unemployment is greater than or equal to 25% in 2021. 

 List all countries where youth unemployment is less than or equal to 1% in 2021.  

Top 10 countries that have an average high rate of youth unemployment from 2017 to 2021  

Top 10 countries that have an average low rate of youth unemployment from 2017 to 2021  

Top 10 countries that have a high COVID impact (for years 2019 and 2020)  

Top 10 countries that have a less COVID impact (for years 2019 and 2020)
